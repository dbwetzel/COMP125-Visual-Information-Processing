# Why Learn Coding and/or Programming
*Getting Started with Coding in Javascript and P5*

Lately, we have seen the rise of many new AI tools that can write code, and sometimes do so pretty well. But in this class, we will learn the nuts and bolts of coding in P5 and JavaScript by doing to coding by hand. It's important here to really do the work yourself, because the goal is not to get a piece of software out into the market, but rather to train your thinking in a new way. The purpose of this course is to get you to consider how a computer program works, step-by-step, and to gain a clear understanding of all the key concepts, tools, and mechanisms available to the programmer. If you never write another line of code again after this class, that's OK. You will still have gained some valuable experience in learning a new syntax, learning to think through a problem sequentially, analyzing the logical flow of a program, and troubleshooting. If you go on to work with a software engineer on a project, or even if you end up using AI programming tools in the future, you will be better equipped by knowing how things work and what is possible.

## How will this course help you in the future?

The impact of this course on some students will be that they pursue programming in some form, maybe in Game Design, or possibly to support their interests in another field (such as Digital Humanities, Bioinformatics, Finance, or Digital Media). Many students will at least understand the realities of programming so that when they need to work with a software developer on a project (and chances are, they will at some point, regardless of their field), they will be in a better position to understand the work being done and be able to ask the right questions. The main distinguishing feature of this course for students is that they will have produced a portfolio of programming work that they can show, and perhaps build on for future projects.

## How to succeed in this course

Programming skills are built up gradually by doing the work on a regular basis. Please don't put off the lab exercises or try to do everything at the last minute. This is not a class you can "cram" at the end. Due dates are not "do" dates! We will have short, simple assignments that keep you moving forward. They should not be overwhelming if you stay engaged each week. Please try to stay on top of the deadlines. If you wait until the last minute to start your work or you let too many lab assignments pile up, you will get confused and I won't be able to help you much. If you are confused about an assignment, please ask for help. Do that sooner rather than later!

The first two lab assignments are designed to verify that you have everything you need to get started in this course. Lab 0 - Setup asks you to first create an account on "editor.p5js.org" and launch a sample project from a template. The first one (Lab 1 - Getting Started with P5.js) is a simple exercise to verify that P5.js is working properly. The second lab assignment (Lab 2 - Draw!) is to try out some of the exercises in the class textbook, drawing pictures with code. Fun!

If you keep up on the (mostly simple) assignments and ask a lot of questions, you will do just fine, even if you've never written a line of code before.
