# Hello P5!
*Getting Started with Coding in Javascript and P5*

**P5** ([P5js.org](https://p5js.org)) is based on **Processing** ([processing.org](https://processing.org)) and was designed by and for artists seeking to create data visualizations quickly and with minimal or no background in coding or computer science. In this course we will use P5 to create interactive drawings and animations that run in a web page. All our work will be online, and your animations and interactive web apps will be accessible and sharable with simple web links.

P5 is a **JavaScript** library, and so to work in P5 is to work in JavaScript. Some of the work we will do in this course is specific to P5, and some of the work we will do is fundamental to the JavaScript language. 

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It looks a lot like other programming languages, such as C and Java (no relation!), but with one important differnce: Javascript is a *scripting* language in that it can't really turn your code into a stand-alone aplication. Instead, it leverages the built-in capabilities of existing applications, such as your web browser, through a "run-time environment" that interprets the code. JavaScript is used most commonly to make web pages *dynamic* and *interactive*. JavaScript programs might be embedded directly in the `html` code of a web page or included as a separate text file. You can extend your programming capabilities in JavaScript by connecting to one of the many available code libraries, such as P5.js.
