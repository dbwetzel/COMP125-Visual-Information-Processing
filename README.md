## COMP125 Visual Information Processing
*Learning materials and examples for an introductory course in programming with P5.js*

**David B. Wetzel, May-June 2025**

This is a set of materials for "Visual Information Processing" (COMP 125) a course developed at <a href="https://luc.edu" target="_blank">Loyola University Chicago</a> for non-CS majors as part of the "Quantitative Awareness" category of the University Core Curriculum. It is intended as a gentle introduction to the art of computer programming through the lens of computer graphics and animation. No prior experience in computer programming is required.

This web site is a collection of the tutorials, examples, assignments, and code templates I have developed over the past nine years of teaching this course, first in Processing, and then in P5.js.
