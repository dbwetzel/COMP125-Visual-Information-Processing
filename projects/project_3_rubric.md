| Criteria | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 |
| ---   | ---       | --- | --- |
| **Step 1 - Screen Navigation:** Project has three screens: start, play, game over. Navigation between screens is controlled by user interaction and/or timers | **Missing or non-functional.** Navigation is not working or not implemented; Syntax or runtime errors may prevent this feature from working properly. 0 Points | **Partial Implementation.** Screen navigation may be disordered but basically functional; One or more steps may be missing that cause odd program behavior. 12 Points | **Meets expectations.** User can click through three screens (cyclical): Start, Play, and Game Over. 17 Points |
| **Step 2 - Player Object:** Player object file is imported and linked and appears on screen in "play" mode; player movement is controlled by the user | **Missing or non-functional.** Player object is not imported or linked to the project (index.html); Player object is not instantiated correctly due to errors; Player object is not movable by the user due to syntax or runtime errors. 0 Points | **Partial implementation.** Player object may be properly instantiated but is not controllable by the mouse or keyboard; Other possible issues (fixable) with the player object. 12 Points | **Meets Expectations.** Navigation has been modified to prevent mouse click triggering "Game Over" state; Player object appears on screen in "Play" mode and is controlled by the user (mouse or keyboard). 17 Points |
|**Step 3 - Timers:** Timer object is imported and linked; timer instance controls play-mode time-out (advance to "game over" automatically) | **Missing or non-functional.** Timer object is not imported or linked; Timer instance not properly instantiated; syntax or runtime errors prevent the timer from functioning properly. 0 Points | **Partial Implementation.** Timer object may be properly instantiated (imported and linked) but is not properly or fully implemented; Timer may not properly control screen navigation; Elapsed time may not be shown on screen. 12 Points |**Meets expectations.** gameTimer instance of Timer is properly instantiated and applied to control a "timeout" for the "Play" mode leading to "Game Over" after a specified time interval; Elapsed time is shown on screen in Play mode. 17 Points |
| **Step 4 - Arrays and Collision Detection:** "Box" object (or equivalent) is imported and linked; Multiple instances of the "box" are managed in an array; box spawning controlled by timer instance; collisions and "misses" (box leaves the screen) affect the array size (remove from array) | **Missing or non-functional.** Box object may not be imported or properly linked; Syntax or runtime errors in the box implementation may prevent the program from running. Array may not be properly declared, initialized, or implemented. 0 Points | **Partial Implementation.** Collision detection may not be fully implemented; Collisions or "misses" may not result in object disposal (.splice()); other issues or logical errors. 12 Points |**Meets expectations.** In Play mode, user sees "box" objects (or equivalent) spawning at intervals controlled by a timer instance. Collisions with the player object result in disposal of the box object from the array; boxes leaving the screen are removed from the array. 17 Points |
| **Step 5 - Scoring and Reset:** Score variable is declared (global); points are accrued for catching/avoiding "box" objects; score, box array, and player location reset on new game (from game over or splash) | **Missing or non-functional.** Scoring is not implemented. 0 Points | **Partial Implementation.** Scoring may be implemented, but new game does not reset either score, or array, or player object. 12 Points | **Meets expectations.** Score variable is declared (global); points are accrued for catching/avoiding "box" objects; score, box array, and player location reset on new game (from game over or splash). 17 Points |
| **Technical Enhancements:** Points for additional objects; levels of difficulty; changes to the game mechanics; Changes to the game objective, etc | **No Enhancements.** Game play and functionality is unchanged from the step-by-step tutorial. 0 Points | **Minimal Enhancements.** Some slight changes to the behavior of the game are implemented. 1-3 Points | **Exceeds expectations.** Changes to the game include re-arranged mechanics (direction, speed, movement rules, etc); new objectives; levels of difficulty, etc. 7 Points |
|**Creative Enhancements:** Graphical enhancements to backgrounds or sprite objects | **No Enhancements.** Game object and backgrounds are unchanged from the step-by-step tutorial. 0 Points | **Minimal Enhancements.** Minimal changes or enhancements to sprite images or backgrounds. 1-4 Points | **Exceeds expectations.** Player object replaced with student's own sprite image (1-2 pts); "Box" image replaced with original image (1-2 pts); additional sprites (1-2 pt); Creative changes to backgrounds and text (1-2 pts). 8 Points |
