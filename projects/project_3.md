# Project 3 - Online Game
*Create an interactive game for the web*

Use this link to get started

* **Log in** to the editor
* **Save your own copy** (file->duplicate)

See the step by step tutorials under Course Content in Sakai to get the basic version of the game working.

Each student will turn in their own original work. This is not a group project, but I am hoping you will work in teams to troubleshoot and assist each other.

If you're OK with a grade of no more than 85% (B), you can turn in the results of the Project 3 Step-by-Step tutorials for a very basic but functional game. If you want higher than a 'B', you have to put some personal creativity into it!

## Minimum features of your game project:

* A "splash" screen with an introduction to your game
* a "play" screen where the game happens
* a "game over" screen that the player sees when the game ends
* Objects that move independently on screen (arrays, individual objects, etc)
* Object constructor code contained in separate .js files (linked to the main sketch by the HTML file)
* A "player" object controlled by the user 
* A Timer that controls something in the game (appearance of additional objects, a time limit on a challenge, etc.)
* An action that the user takes that scores points (eliminate threats, keep a ball in play, reach a goal, etc)
* A display of points on screen (visual feedback)
* Other features that will make your game better (and add points to your total):

    * Creative Enhancements  (+1-8 points)
    * Replace the Player object .display() method code with your own graphic design 
    * Replace the Box object .display() method code with your own graphic design 
    * Replace the backgrounds in the 'play,' 'splash,' and 'game over' screens 
    * Technical Enhancements (+1-7 points)
    * Multiple levels
    * Multiple objectives
    * Changes to basic game play
    * Multiple objects with different purposes (more than one type of obstacle or objective)
    * Other ideas expressed in code that make the game better

**Addendum:** Collaboration allowed/encouraged! For this project, I encourage you to find a buddy in this class with whom you might collaborate in any number of ways. First of all, it's good to have someone to brainstorm with. Also, it's great to have someone that can test and help debug/troubleshoot. For this project, I would not object if you actually shared code with one another as long as it is properly credited. For instance, if you have an object constructor that you have created that could be used in a colleague's game, and you would like to share it, go ahead. Just make sure the name of the person that created it is prominently displayed in a code comment. Always give credit for creative contributions from others!

So, while this is not actually a group project, I would be delighted to know that you are actually working together.
