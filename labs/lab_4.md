## Lab 4 - For Loops
*Draw repeating shapes using an interative structure*

Use the following template link to get started:
* <a href ="https://editor.p5js.org/dbwetzel/sketches/eG8hPWguF" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/dbwetzel/sketches/eG8hPWguF</a>
* **log in** to your editor account on p5.js
* **File->Duplicate** to make your own copy

### Coding Instructions

* use the `for()` loop (already created for you) to draw ten smiley faces (`smiley()` function) while adding **only one line** of code at line 17 (inside the `for()` loop)
```javascript
16    for(let i = 0; i > 10; i++){
17
18    }
```
* horizontally, start 50px from the left edge and space them evenly 55px apart (first argument to `smiley()`)
* place them vertically 50px from the top of the canvas (second argument to `smiley()`)
* remember that the value of `i` changes with each iteration of the loop (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) up to one less than 10. You can use that to place the smileys horizontally
