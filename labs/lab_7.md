## Lab 7 - Working with Text and Fonts
*Add text to a P5 sketch*

Use the following template link to get started:
* <a href ="https://editor.p5js.org/dbwetzel/sketches/ce5g7FuqZ" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/dbwetzel/sketches/ce5g7FuqZ</a>
* **log in** to your editor account on p5.js
* **File->Duplicate** to make your own copy

The second half of chapter 7 in your textbook is devoted to putting text on the canvas and working with fonts. In this exercise, you will store a string of text in a variable and display it on screen. In addition, you will add some interactive features that will change the text and its display according to user actions.

### Instructions:

Modify the sketch in four ways:

1. change the text strings to your own two phrases
2. make the second phrase appear only when the mouse is pressed
3. change the font to something besides Arial (maybe a different font/size for each phrase?)
4. make the second phrase REPLACE the first phrase when the mouse is pressed (use an `if() else` structure and be careful about text coordinates)

**Extra credit** (1 point each):
* add an image to your sketch (jpg, gif, png)
* add a sound that plays when you click the mouse

### When you're done:
* Make sure you save your work in the P5 editor (**File->Save**)
* Download a backup copy and submit the .zip file (**File->Download**)
* Share a link to your sketch (**File->Share->Edit**)
